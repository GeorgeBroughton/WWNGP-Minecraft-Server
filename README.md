Weedie Mc Wack Next Gen Pack | Minecraft Server | Docker Container

This project just installs all the prerequisites for `Weedie McWack's Next Gen Pack` server, puts it into the docker container and runs it. By all means edit this in any way you see fit.

This is thanks to [itzg](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) who created the docker container in the first place.
